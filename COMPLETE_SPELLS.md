- [x] Homebrew

***1st-level divination***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 15 minutes
- **Range:** self
- **Shape:** aura
- **Radius:** 30 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration, ritual
- **Material Components:** a holy symbol

---

## Description
For the duration, you sense the presence of divine energy fields within 30 feet of you.
An aura of divine patterns appears to eminate from each source of energy in the area.
A more subtle presence may require a successful Wisdom Ability Check to notice.

If you sense energy fields in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any creature or object in the area that bears a divine presence, and you learn thier alignment, if any.

Doing so reveals any creature that is an abberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead&mdash;as well as their location within the spell's area.

In addition, you know if there is a place or object within the spell's area that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 3 feet of wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or magical silence.

> These energy fields are typically laced with divine powers of good, evil, law, and chaos.
> However, neutral energies remain imperceptible, even by this spell.
> 
> Humanoids, beasts and other mundane creatures generally emit weak and barely noticeable auras because of this.
> Conversely, interplanar visitors often exude colorful and readily apparent auras.

Choose a weapon that you are holding.
It sprouts enchanted stems and leaves that last until the end of your next turn.

On a successful save, the target is freed.

The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine.
Once you give a command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability.
If a given task would take longer than one round to complete, it takes on an autonomous locomotion on each of your turns until its task is complete.
The servant waits for your next command once it finishes a task.
The servant can move up to 30 feet each time you command it.

The servant can't attack, cast spells, activate magic items, or carry more than 20 pounds.

# Disguise Self
- [x] Homebrew

***1st-level illusion***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Range:** self
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic

---

## Description
You make yourself&mdash;including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person&mdash;look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it.
You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between.
You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs.
Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection.
For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair.
If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence Ability Check against your Spell Save DC.

- **Shape:** special
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** 50 feet of rope worth atleast 1 sp, which the spell consumes

---

## Description
As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle on the ground or the floor.
When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.

Choose the size of the trap: *small*, *medium*, *large*, or *huge*.
The rope magically transforms to match the respectively chosen size.
This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Wisdom Ability Check against your Spell Save DC to be discerned.

The trap triggers when a creature of the same size as the trap moves onto the ground or floor in the spell's radius.
The trap also triggers for creatures that are one size larger or smaller than the trap.
That creature must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down several feet above the ground or the floor.
The target is then **restrained** there indefinately.
Once per day, the target can use an action to make a Dexterity Saving Throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Alternatively, someone else outside the trap who can reach the target can use an action to help them get out of the trap.
They must make a Dexterity Ability Check against your Spell Save DC to undo the magical ropes.
On a successful check, the **restrained** effect ends on the target.

On a failed save, the beast is **charmed** by you for the spell's duration.

Once per round, you can use your action to issue commands to the beast through the link, and it obeys as best as it can.
Otherwise, your beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting itself and you.

# Illusory Projection
- [x] Homebrew

***1st-level illusion***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 15 minutes
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Shape:** cube
- **Length:** 15 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a bit of fleece

---

## Description
You create a convincingly realistic image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot-long cube.
The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration.
You have full control over the image's animation within its space.
The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.

You can cause the image to move to any spot within range at any time (no action required).
As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image.
For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.
You can also adjust the percieved physics of the image, such as how wind, light, and gravity interacts with it.
Detailed arrangements&mdash;like flowing cloaks, water, and hair&mdash;are intuitively taken care of through your magic.

If the illusion is of a moving creature or object, it has an AC of `9 + your Spellcasting Ability Modifier`.
Attacks and other forms of sudden physical collision with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.
A creature that uses its action to explicitly examine or interact with the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence Saving Throw.
If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

> Tip: a player always knows somethings up if they are asked make a saving throw.
> Especially if it is a weird one, like Intelligence.
> In these cases, players can guess that they are making a check for an illusion&mdash;whether or not they pass.
> That means the cat is out of the bag for an illusion.
> The jig is up!
> 
> Half the fun in illusions is that the players don't know when an illusion exists.
> So, try to frame it a bit differently for illusions.
> Ask for an intelligence check, but give them proficiency if you know they are proficient in intelligence saving throws.
> If you aren't sure which players have this proficiency without asking, check their class.
> Classes with proficiency in Intelligence Saving Throws include:
> - Artificers
> - Druids
> - Mystics
> - Rogues
> - Wizards

## Description
You gain the service of a bound spirit that hails from another plane of existance.
Typically, this spirit come from the Feywild, the Nine Hells, or Elysium.
When you cast this spell, this immortal entity is mystically selected and bonded to you.

Once your companion spirit is selected, you channel it into a beast that you must hold or touch for the spell's casting time.
This spell can only affect limited selection of animals (at the DM's discretion, other animals might be available):
- bats
- cats
- crabs
- frogs or toads
- hawks
- lizards
- octopuses
- owls
- snakes
- fish or quippers
- rats
- ravens
- sea horses
- spiders
- weasels

When the spell completes, it fuses your companion spirit with the animal's body.
A mystic symbiosis forms, creating a familiar&mdash;boosting the animal's self-awareness, and gifting the bound spirit with a new mortal form.
Your familiar keeps the statistics of its chosen form and is **charmed** by you.

While your familiar is **charmed** by you in this way, you form a telepathic link with it while you are within 120 feet of one another.
Through the link, your familiar can understand your telepathic messages to it, and it can telepathically communicate simple emotions and concepts back to you.
Once per round, you can use your bonus action to issue commands to the beast through the link, and it obeys as best as it can.
Otherwise, your familiar acts on its own, focusing on protecting itself and you.
Your familiar rolls its own initiative, however it can choose to take its turn directly after you on your initiative count.

You can use your action to see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears, and continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses.
During this time, you gain the benefits of any special senses possessed by your familiar, though you are **blinded**, **deafened**, and **stunned** as your body reels from temporarily shutting down.
Also as an action, you can cause your familiar to teleport to any unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, or to a safe location that you are both familiar with.
Any items that the familiar is carrying are not teleported with it.

When you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell.
Your familiar must be within 120 feet of you, and it must use its action to deliver the spell when you cast it.
If the spell requires an Attack Roll or Saving Throw, you use your own spellcasting statistics for the roll.

You can't have more than one familiar at a time.
If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you can transfer your bound spirit to the new target animal, causing your familiar to adopt a new form.
When your familiar drops to 0 hit points, the animal dies, and your companion spirit drifts to its home plane until you cast this spell again.

# Detect Thoughts
- [x] Homebrew

***2nd-level divination***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 5 minutes
- **Range:** self
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a copper piece

---

## Description
For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures.
When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you.
Your focus on a target ends once it is either out of sight or out of range.
If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature&mdash;what is most on its mind in that moment.
As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, or attempt to lock onto a creature to probe deeper into its mind.
If you choose to probe deeper, you can no longer shift your attention to another creature for the duration of this spell.

When you probe a creature’s deep thoughts, it must make a Intelligence Saving Throw.
If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, its relevant knowledge, and anything that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates).
If it succeeds, the spell ends Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make another Intelligence Saving Throw; if it succeeds, the spell ends.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of both its surface and deep thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see.
When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you.
The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.
You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.

Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.

When a creature moves through the spell's area or ends its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
It takes this `2d10` radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The space can hold as many as eight *medium* or smaller creatures.
The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space.

Attacks and spells can't cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope.

Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.

You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice.
Your unarmed strikes deal `1d6` bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes.
Alternatively, these appendages can mimic any weapon of your choosing, such as a greatsword or whip.
Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a `+1` magical bonus to the Attack & Damage Rolls you make using it.

### Sprout Wings
You adapt your body for flight, sprouting large, unwieldly wings and losing body weight.
Once on each of your turns, you can use an action to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of your next turn.
If you don't take this action before the end of your turn while you are aloft, you plummet to the ground.
You can't fly in this way if you are wearing medium or heavy armor.

***2nd-level evocation***
- **Casting Time:** bonus action
- **Duration:** 5 minutes
- **Range:** self
- **Tags:** verbal, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a weapon

---

## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
It begins to gleam and glimmer with astral starlight, shedding dim light in a 10-foot radius.
Until the spell ends, you have advantage on Weapon Attacks using this weapon, and it is considered magical (if it isn't already).
The first time you hit with a Weapon Attack using this weapon before the spell ends, weird symbols cascade upon your target, and the spell ends.
The attack deals an extra `2d10` force damage in addition to the weapon's normal damage and effects.
The extra damage increases by `1d10` if the target is **invisible** or **shapeshifted**, and those effects end.

Glittery particles fill the target's space, emitting a dim light in a 10-foot aura around it until the end of your next turn.
Until then, attacks made against the target within 10 feet of it have advantage, and the target cannot become **invisible** or **shapeshifted**.

If you let go of the weapon, its magic dissipates, and the spell ends.
It also ends if you make a Ranged Attack with the weapon and miss.
Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage dealt by the attack increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 2nd.

# Augury
- [x] Homebrew

***2nd-level divination***
- **Casting Time:** 5 minutes
- **Duration:** instantaneous
- **Range:** self
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, ritual
- **Material Components:** specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 sp

---

## Description
By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next hour.
The DM chooses from the following possible omens:
- Weal, for good results
- Woe, for bad results
- Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
- Nothing, for results that aren't especially good or bad

The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative `25%` chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading.
The DM makes this roll in secret.

# Phantasmal Force
- [x] Homebrew

***2nd-level illusion***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 5 minutes
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a bit of fleece

---

## Description
You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range.
The target must make an Intelligence Saving Throw.
On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot-long cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration.
This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.

The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence Ability Check against your Spell Save DC.
If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.

While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real.
The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm.
For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge.
If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall&mdash;it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.

An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion.
A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target.
Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target.
Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal `1d6` psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking.
The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

## Description
> When I met Jim Darkmagic, I wondered how he got anything done in that outfit.
> I have since learned that most of his talents involve standing and talking.
> His outfit is perfect for that.
> 
> &mdash; Môrgæn

Jim Darkmagic is said to have invented this spell, originally calling it *I said what?!* Have you ever been talking to the local monarch and accidentally mentioned how their son looks like your favorite hog from when you were growing up on the family farm? We've all been there! But rather than being beheaded for an honest slip of the tongue, you can pretend it never happened&mdash;by ensuring that no one knows it happened.

When you cast this spell, you skillfully reshape the memories of listeners in your immediate area, so that each creature of your choice that you can see forgets everything you said within the last 10 seconds.
Those creatures then remember that you actually said the words you speak as the verbal component of the spell.

# Detect Traps
- [x] Homebrew

***2nd-level divination***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** instantaneous
- **Range:** 120 feet

---

## Description
You sense the presence of every trap within range that is within line of sight.
A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator.
Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the [*alarm*](../level-1/alarm.md) spell, a [*glyph of warding*](../level-3/glyph-of-warding.md), or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

This spell merely reveals that each trap is present.
You don't learn the location of a trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by each trap you sense.

The music moves with you, centered on you for the duration.
Until the spell ends, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a `+10` bonus to Charisma Ability Checks made to perform before an audience.

In addition, a creature that receives this bonus can use an action on each of their turns to beguile one creature they choose within 30 feet of you that can hear the music.
The creature must make a Charisma Saving Throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are hostile to it.
On a failure, the creature becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as it can hear the music.

- The target's target's hit point maximum decreases by `1d8` for the duration

This spell only affects one target object or creature.
If the target is fitted with cloth, armor, or other equipment that becomes too large for the target's new form, it harmlessly drops to the ground in the target's original space.

If there isn't enough room for the target to increase its size when this spell ends, it either breaks the environment around it, breaks itself, or becomes **restrained** until the spell ends.

> This spell can be also be used to disable a target creature.
> A *small* creature can't wield heavy weapons effectively and must wield versatile weapons with two hands.
> A *tiny* creature has trouble with all but light weapons.

- **Range:** touch
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** 100 gallons of water, three sponges, and soap worth atleast 2 sp, which the spell consumes, and a vehicle that you own worth at least 500 sp

---

## Description
You gain the service of a powerful familiar, a divine spirit that hails from another plane of existance.
It becomes your steed.
Typically, familiars come from the Feywild, the Nine Hells, or Elysium.
When you cast this spell for the very first time, this immortal entity is mystically selected and bonded to you.

You channel this familiar into a nonmilitary land vehicle that is, defacto, owned by you, which you hold or touch for the spell's casting time.
The vehicle has the statistics of a normal vehicle of its sort, though it is celestial, fey, or fiendish (your choice) instead of a construct.
The physical characteristics of the vehicle reflect its origin to some degree.
For example, a fiendish SUV might be jet black in color, with tinted windows and a sinister-looking front grille.
Additionally, if your vehicle has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.

A mystic symbiosis forms, granting the vehicle with self-awareness, and gifting the familiar with a new mortal form.
These two entities share the same mind and body.
When your vehicle drops to 0 hit points, it dies, and your familiar drifts to its home plane until you cast this spell again.

You have a supernatural bond with the divine vehicle that allows you to drive beyond your normal ability.
While driving the divine vehicle, you are considered proficient with vehicles of its type, and you add double your proficiency bonus to Ability Checks related to driving the vehicle.
While driving the vehicle, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target the vehicle.

While your divine vehicle is within 1 mile of you, a telepathic link is active.
Through the link, your vehicle can understand your telepathic messages to it, and it can telepathically communicate simple emotions and concepts back to you.

While the link is active, you can issue commands to your vehicle on your turn, and it obeys your commands loyally.
It takes its turn directly after you on your initiative count.
You can use your bonus action to telepathically command it to move and otherwise act until the beginning of your next turn.
Otherwise, your vehicle acts on its own, focusing on protecting itself and you.

You can use your action to sense through your vehicle's sensors, and continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses.
During this time, you gain the benefits of any special senses possessed by your vehicle, though you are **blinded**, **deafened**, and **stunned** as your body reels from temporarily shutting down.

You can't have more than one divine vehicle bonded by this spell at a time.

Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, they must roll a percentile die to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

With two duplicates, they must roll more than `66%`.
With one duplicate, they must roll more than `50%`.

You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met.
Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature.
Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 15 minutes.
Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.

When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke.
If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object's mouth.

The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration.
If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets.
If the condition isn't met before the spell expires, the activity isn't performed.

If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.

# Find Steed

- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Duration:** instantaneous
- **Range:** touch
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** 250 sp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that must be consumed by a fire in a brass brazier

---

## Description
You gain the service of a powerful familiar, a divine spirit that hails from another plane of existance.
It becomes your steed.
Typically, familiars come from the Feywild, the Nine Hells, or Elysium.
When you cast this spell for the very first time, this immortal entity is mystically selected and bonded to you.

You channel this familiar into a friendly, willing beast that you hold or touch for the spell's casting time.
This spell can only affect limited selection of animals: horses, ponies, camels, elk, or mastiffs. (Your DM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) When the spell completes, it fuses this familiar entity with the animal's body.
Your companion keeps the statistics of its form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.
Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.

A mystic symbiosis forms, amplifying the animal's self-awareness, and gifting the familiar with a new mortal form.
These two entities share the same mind and body.
When your companion drops to 0 hit points, the animal dies, and your familiar drifts to its home plane until you cast this spell again.

Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit.
While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.

While your steed is within 1 mile of you, a telepathic link is active.
Through the link, your steed can understand your telepathic messages to it, and it can telepathically communicate simple emotions and concepts back to you.

While the link is active, you can issue commands to your steed on your turn, and it obeys your commands loyally.
It takes its turn directly after you on your initiative count.
You can use your bonus action to telepathically command it to move and otherwise act until the beginning of your next turn.
Otherwise, your steed acts on its own, focusing on protecting itself and you.

You can use your action to see through your steed's eyes and hear what it hears, and continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses.
During this time, you gain the benefits of any special senses possessed by your steed, though you are **blinded**, **deafened**, and **stunned** as your body reels from temporarily shutting down.

Also as an action, you can cause your steed to teleport to any unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, or to a safe location that you are both familiar with.

You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.
As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, reverting the effects of this spell.

Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your steed can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell.
Your steed must be within 1 mile of you, and it must use its action to deliver the spell when you cast it.
If the spell requires an Attack Roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

---

## Description
One humanoid of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or become **charmed** by you for the duration.
While the target is **charmed** in this way, a twisted crown of jagged iron appears on its head, and a madness glows in its eyes.

The **charmed** target must use its movement before acting on each of its turns to move towards a creature that you mentally choose.
If the **charmed** target can not end its movement within 5 feet of the chosen creature, it uses the *dash* action to close the distance.

Once within 5 feet of the chosen creature, the **charmed** creature must target it with its most effective Melee Attacks (at the DM's discretion) until it is killed.
If it does so and the **charmed** target has any remaining attacks or movement, you must mentally choose what its next target creature is.
It tries to move towards that creature and attack it in a similar fashion.

If you do not command the creature to move or attack when it can still do so, the spell ends.
On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control over the target, or the spell ends.
Also, the target can make a Wisdom Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns.
On a success, the spell ends.

All the familiars conjured by this spell must be the same type of creature (celestials, fey, or fiends; your choice).
If you already have a familiar conjured by the [*find familiar*](./find-familiar) spell or similar means, then one fewer familiars are conjured by this spell.

Familiars summoned by this spell can telepathically communicate with you and share their visual or auditory senses while they are within 1 mile of you.

When you cast a spell with a range of touch, one of the familiars conjured by this spell can deliver the spell, as normal.
However, you can cast a touch spell through only one familiar per turn.

## At Higher Levels

Otherwise, you must succeed on an Wisdom Saving Throw against the chosen curse's Spell Save DC (determined by its original curse layer) plus its level.
You have a bonus on this Saving Throw equal to this spell's level (normally three).
On a success, you destroy the magic and the chosen curse is lifted.
If you fail this save by 10 or more, the curse spreads to you as well.

If the target is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.
In this case, the DM adjucates the approximate spell level used to curse the item.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can lift a curse with no Saving Throw if the disrupted curse's level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.

You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone.
You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell.
You otherwise can't move.

Minor physical damage to the stone doesn't harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals `3d12` bludgeoning damage to you.

	- Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points.

- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, concentration

## Description
You summon spirits of nature that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range.
Choose one of the following options for what appears:
- One beast of challenge rating 2 or lower
- Two beasts of challenge rating 1 or lower
- Four beasts of challenge rating &frac12; or lower
- Eight beasts of challenge rating &frac14; or lower

The DM chooses the beasts that might be available in the current environment, such as tigers or wolves, and you choose the unoccupied spaces you can see within range where they appear.
A summoned beast loses its compulsion to help you when the spell ends.

The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions.
Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns.
They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you).
If you don't issue any commands to them, they contribute to combat by defending themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions (at the DM's discretion).

The DM has the creatures' statistics.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 5th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level slot, and four times as many with a 9th-level slot.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed.
The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse.
When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount.
The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.

When you cast the spell&mdash;and as a bonus action thereafter&mdash;you can expend one the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet of you.
Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes.
Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A creature takes `3d6` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The clouds form 120 feet above the ground, and have a 60-foot radius.

Precipitation violently plummets from the clouds at once.
The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.

If a creature is concentrating in the spell's area when you first cast it, the creature must make a successful Constitution Saving Throw against your Spell Save DC or lose concentration.
You do not need to make this initial save.

Then, you can choose the type of precipitation, which each have varying effects.

### Downpour
Heavy rain and wind fills the area.
This choice requires no concentration.
You can end this spell at any time (no action required).

### Hailstorm
A creature who moves through the hailstorm or starts its turn there must make a Strength Saving Throw.

# Tiny Servant
- [x] Homebrew

***3rd-level transmutation***
- **Casting Time:** 5 minutes
- **Duration:** 1 day
- **Range:** touch
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic

---

## Description
You touch one *tiny*, nonmagical object that isn't attached to another object or a surface and isn't being carried by another creature.
The target animates and sprouts little arms and legs, becoming a creature under your control until the spell ends or the creature drops to 0 hit points.
The servant has the statistics as shown on the Tiny Servent Statistics table outlined at the end of this spell's description.

When you cast the spell, you can mentally command the servant to interact with the environment around it. (If you control multiple creatures with this spell, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) The servant can perform simple tasks, such as fetching things, standing watch, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine.
Once you give a command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability.
If a given task would take longer than one round to complete, it takes on an autonomous locomotion on each of your turns until its task is complete.
The servant waits for your next command once it finishes a task.
If you issue no commands, the servant does nothing other than defend itself against hostile creatures.
As an action, you can command the servant once again for further service.
The servant can move up to 30 feet each time you command it.

When the creature drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.

#### Tiny Servant Statistics
| AC | HP             | STR      | DEX       | CON      | INT      | WIS       | CHA      |

# Incite Greed

***3rd-level enchantment***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 5 minutes
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Shape:** sphere
- **Radius:** 30 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** a gem worth at least 50 sp

---

## Description
When you cast this spell, you hurl the gem used as the material component to any spot within range.
Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the coin must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or become **charmed** by you for the duration.

While **charmed** in this way, a creature can do nothing but use its movement and action to make a Wisdom Ability Check and greedily search for the gem.
The difficulty of this check is equal to `your Spell Save DC + 10`.

An affected creature can repeat its Saving Throw if it is ever attacked, targeted by a spell, or damaged.
Otherwise the spell lasts for the duration, or until gem is found.

# Lightning Strike

***3rd-level transmutation***
- **Casting Time:** bonus action
- **Duration:** 5 minutes
- **Range:** self
- **Tags:** verbal, material
- **Material Components:** a weapon

---

## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
It becomes hot with electric energy until the end of your next turn.
The weapon is considered magical for the duration (if it isn't already).
The first time you make an attack using this weapon before the spell ends, it delivers a powerful shock your target, and the spell ends.
The target gains no benefit from cover for this attack.
If the attack hits, it deals an extra `3d8` lightning damage to the target in addition to the weapon's normal damage and effects.

Hit or miss, the weapon&mdash;or its ammunition&mdash;transforms into a bolt of lightning.
The lightning forms a 5-foot-wide line that extends out from you to the target of your attack.
Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity Saving Throw, including the target of this attack.
A creature takes `3d8` lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
If the attack hits your initial target, then it automatically fails its save.
The ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form.

If you let go of the weapon, its charm dissipates, and the spell ends.

## At Higher Levels
If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage for both effects of the spell increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 3rd.

# Daylight

***3rd-level evocation***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic

---

## Description
Choose an object or point within range.
If you choose an object, it must be no larger than 10 feet in any dimension.
Until the spell ends, the source you chose sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius. The light can be colored as you like.
Completely covering the source with something opaque blocks the light.
The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.

When you first cast this spell or as an action, you can end the spell by expelling its remaining energy, causing the source you chose to flare with blinding light.
Each creature within the sphere of bright light created by this spell must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or become **blinded** for 5 minutes.
A creature can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

# Magic Circle

- **Height:** 60 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, ritual
- **Material Components:** a pound of salt, and powdered iron/silver or a volume of holy water worth at least 100 sp, which the spell consumes

---

## Description
You create a 20-foot-radius, 60-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range.
Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.

Until the spell ends, the circle is protected against one or more of the following types of creatures of your choice: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The magic circle grants several benefits.
When a creature of the chosen type targets any number of creatures within the spell's area with an attack, spell, or ability, they must flip `a coin`.
On a `tails`, those creatures within the circle are not affected by the action.
In addition, creatures within the circle can't be **charmed**, **frightened**, or possessed by creatures of the chosen type.
Creatures within the circle have advantage on any new Saving Throw against such affects if they are already **charmed**, **frightened**, or possessed by such a creature.

Creatures of the chosen type also can't willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means.
If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel while in the circle, it must first succeed on a Charisma Saving Throw.

When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.

# Enemies Abound
- [x] Homebrew

***3rd-level enchantment***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, concentration

---

## Description
You reach into the mind of one creature you can see and force it to make a Wisdom Saving Throw or become **frightened** by every creature it can see for the duration.
While the target is **frightened** in this way, it loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies until the spell ends.

The **frightened** creature must begin each of its turns by using an action to attack or cast a spell against the closest and largest batch of enemies, using its best resources to fight and otherwise survive (at the DM's discretion).
If the is not in range to attack or cast a spell, it must use its action to take the *dash* action and move away from its percieved enemies by the safest availabe route on its turn, unless it has nowhere to move.
The target cannot use bonus actions while **frightened** in this way, and must use its reaction to attack if it ever has the opportunity.

The **frightened** creature can move as normal on its turn.
If there are multiple sources of fear restricting its movement, it can move towards a source of fear if it is moving away from at least two others.

If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to another creature, the creature can make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
On a successful save, the spell ends.

You open a gateway to the dark between the stars, a region infested with unknown horrors.
A 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness and bitter cold appears, centered on a point within range and lasting for the duration.
No light (magical or otherwise) can illuminate the area, and its area is heavily obscured.
Creatures fully within the area are **blinded** and can't take reactions.
This void is filled with a cacophony of soft whispers and slurping noises that can be heard up to 500 feet away.

The void creates a warp in the fabric of space, and the area is difficult terrain.
Any creature that starts its turn in the area takes `2d6` cold damage.
Any creature who moves through the area for the first time on its turn must make a Dexterity Saving Throw or take `2d6` necrotic damage as milky, otherworldy tentacles hurtle toward it.
Any creature that ends its turn in the area takes `2d6` acid damage as the thick air seems to devour and digest its essence.

## Description
This spell plays havoc with electronic devices, making the use of such devices all but impossible.
Select one digital or mechanical device within range.
It is subject to random behavior for the duration.
If the device is held by a creature, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or have the device affected by the spell.

At the start of each of your turns, roll a `d6` for each affected device to determine its behavior.
Except where otherwise indicated, that behavior lasts until the start of your next turn while this spell is in effect.

### Detrimental Behavior

## Description
Flip `a coin` at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the spell.
On a `heads`, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already on that plane).
At the start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from.
If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near).

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can't see anything there more than 60 feet away.

# Major Illusion
- [x] Homebrew

***3rd-level illusion***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 600 feet
- **Shape:** cube
- **Length:** 30 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a bit of fleece

---

## Description
You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 30-foot-long cube.
The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration.
You have full control over the image's animation within its space.
It seems completely real to every sensation, and includes sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted.
You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's stench).

You can cause the image to move to any spot within range at any time (no action required).
As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image.
For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.
You can also adjust the percieved physics of the image, such as how wind, light, and gravity interacts with it.
Detailed arrangements&mdash;like flowing cloaks, water, and hair&mdash;are intuitively taken care of through your magic.

Likewise, detailed yet subtle scents, sounds, and feelings accompany this spell automatically.
Even a certain degree of physical touch holds up to scrutiny.
For example, if you create an illusion of a creature that talks, its lips move and body gesticulates in a believable fashion.
If you create a gushing fountain of water, the cold spittle and wet puddles can be felt by creatures as they enter the illusion's area.
If you cover a foe's equipment in slime, it will be smelly and sticky to them, even as they attempt to wipe the slop off their body.

If the illusion is of a moving creature or object, it has an AC of `9 + your Spellcasting Ability Modifier`.
Attacks and other forms of sudden physical collision with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.
A creature that uses its action to explicitly examine or interact with the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence Saving Throw.
If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

<!--
Tip: a player always knows somethings up if they are asked make a saving throw.
Especially if it is a weird one, like Intelligence.
In these cases, players can guess that they are making a check for an illusion&mdash;whether or not they pass.
That means the cat is out of the bag for an illusion.
The jig is up!

Half the fun in illusions is that the players don't know when an illusion exists.
So, try to frame it a bit differently for illusions.
Ask for an intelligence check, but give them proficiency if you know they are proficient in intelligence saving throws.
If you aren't sure which players have this proficiency without asking, check their class.
Classes with proficiency in Intelligence Saving Throws include:
- Artificers
- Druids
- Mystics
- Rogues
- Wizards
--->

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the spell lasts one full day.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can control the illusion from any distance.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell does not require your concentration.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the spell lasts until it is dispelled.

You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it's wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration.
The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points.
An incorporeal creature isn't affected.

While in this form, the target's only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet.
The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature.

The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces.
The target can't fall and remains hovering in the air even when **stunned** or otherwise **incapacitated**.

While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can't talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with.

## Description
You utter foul words, summoning demons from the chaos of the Abyss.
Roll on the following table to determine what appears.

#### Demons
| `d4` | Demons Summoned                                    |
|------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | One demon of challenge rating 2 or lower           |
| 2    | Two demons of challenge rating 1 or lower          |
| 3    | Four demons of challenge rating &frac12; or lower  |
| 4    | Eight demons of challenge rating &frac14; or lower |

The DM chooses the demons, such as manes or dretches, and you choose the unoccupied spaces you can see within range where they appear.
A summoned demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The demons are hostile to all creatures, including you.
Roll initiative for the summoned demons as a group, which has its own turns.
The demons pursue and attack their favored target to the best of their ability (at the DM's discretion).

As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle on the ground with the blood used as a material component.
The circle is large enough to encompass your space.
While the spell lasts, the summoned demons can't cross the circle or harm it, and they can't target anyone within it.
Using the material component in this manner consumes it when the spell ends.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th or 7th level, you summon twice as many demons.
If you cast it using a spell slot of 8th or 9th level, you summon three times as many demons.

# Dispel Magic
- [x] Homebrew

***3rd-level abjuration***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** instantaneous
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material

**Material:** an opal worth atleast 50 sp, which the spell consumes

---

## Description
Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range.
Then, choose one spell that you know is affecting the target.
If the disrupted spell is of 3rd level or lower, you neutralize the magic and the spell ends.
Otherwise, you must succeed on an Intelligence Saving Throw against the disrupted spell's Spell Save DC (determined by its original spellcaster) plus its level.
You have a bonus on this Saving Throw equal to this spell's level (normally three).
On a success, you neutralize the magic and the disrupted spell ends.
If you fail this save by 10 or more, you take `3d10` force damage as the magic whiplashes back at you.

If the target is a magic item, its magic remains, but the spell breaks its owner's attunement to the object so it can't be used until it is attuned to once again.
In this case, the DM adjucates the approximate spell level used to enchant the item.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can neutralize magic with no Saving Throw if the disrupted spell's level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.
Otherwise, your bonus to the Intelligence Saving Throw increases by 1 for each slot level above 3rd.

The interior of the tower is warm and dry, regardless of conditions outside.
Any equipment or furnishings conjured with the tower dissipate into smoke if removed from it.
At the end of the spell's duration, all creatures and objects within the tower that were not created by the spell appear safely outside on the ground, and all traces of the tower and its furnishings disappear.

You can cast this spell again while it is active to maintain the tower's existence for another full day.
You can create a permanent tower by casting this spell in the same location and with the same configuration every day for one year.

The spirits share a pool of healing power.
With that pool, they can restore up to a total of `30` hit points.
At the start of a creature's turn, the spirits can draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to any creature within the spell's area (no action required), up to the maximum amount remaining in their pool.

While **frightened** by this spell, a creature must use its action to take the *dash* action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move.

If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

# Blinding Smite

***3rd-level evocation***
- **Casting Time:** bonus action
- **Duration:** 5 minutes
- **Range:** self
- **Tags:** verbal, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a weapon

---

## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
It begins to sing a holy hymn in any language (at the DM's discretion) and radiate divine power, pouring out bright light in a 40-foot radius.
The weapon is considered magical for the duration (if it isn't already).
The first time you hit with a Weapon Attack using this weapon before the spell ends, a fervant blast of light pulses from within your target, and the spell ends.
The attack deals an extra `1d20` radiant damage in addition to the weapon's normal damage and effects.
The target must then succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or become **blinded** and **deafened**.
At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Constitution Saving throw, ending both effects on itself on a success.

If you let go of the weapon, its magic dissipates, and the spell ends.
It also ends if you make a Ranged Attack with the weapon and miss.
Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the extra damage increases by `1d20` for each slot level above 3rd.

# Glyph of Warding
- [x] Homebrew

***3rd-level abjuration***
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Duration:** activated
- **Range:** touch
- **Shape:** cube
- **Radius:** 10 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 sp, which the spell consumes

---

## Description
When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect.
You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph.
The glyph can cover an area that can fit within a 10-foot-long cube.
If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence Ability Check against your Spell Save DC to be found.

You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell.
For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed.
For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph.
Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.

You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment.
You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.

### Explosive Runes
When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph.
The sphere spreads around corners.
Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A creature takes `5d8` acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed Saving Throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Spell Glyph
You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph.
The spell must target a single creature or an area.
The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way.
When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast.
If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph.
If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature.
If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it.
If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 3rd.
If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.

The spell enables creatures of any intelligence to understand the meaning of your message.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a `5%` chance that the message doesn't arrive.

The target is **unconscious**, and has resistance to all damage except psychic damage.
If the target is diseased or **poisoned** when you cast the spell, or becomes diseased or **poisoned** while under the spell's effect, the disease and poison have no effect until the spell ends.

The wall lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength Saving Throw.
A creature takes `3d8` bludgeoning damage on a failed save and be knocked **prone**, or half as much damage on a successful one.
A creature must repeat this save every time it moves through the wall.

The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay.
*Small* or smaller flying creatures or objects can't pass through the wall.
Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward.
Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can't pass through it.

At the DM's discretion, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above.

# Animate Dead
- [x] Homebrew

***3rd-level necromancy***
- **Casting Time:** 5 minutes
- **Duration:** instantaneous
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust

---

## Description
This spell creates an undead servant.
Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a *medium* or smaller humanoid within range.
Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature.
The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature's game statistics).

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one).
You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor.
If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures.
Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it.
To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends.
This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.

If you use this spell to maintain control over an undead for a full year, then the creature is permenently under your control until it dies.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd.
Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.

You fire a shot.
Make three attacks within the area.
Then do the other stuff.

You throw a nonmagical weapon or fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition to create a cone of identical weapons that shoot forward and then disappear. 

First, you can make three identical Weapon Attacks against three targets of your choice within a 60-foot cone, using the single weapon or piece of ammunition as required by the spell.
You don't need to provide any further weapons to be thrown or ammo to be fired.

Next, each creature in the spell's area must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A creature takes `3d8` damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The damage type is the same as that of the weapon or ammunition used as a component.

# Speak with Plants
- [x] Homebrew

***3rd-level transmutation***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 15 minutes
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Shape:** sphere
- **Radius:** 30 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, ritual

---

## Description
You imbue plants in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. 

Until this spell ends, you can question plants in the spell's area about events in their immediate vicinity.
Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the plant retains limited knowledge.
It can give information about creatures that have passed, weather patterns, and other recent events.

You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration.
Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.

Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf (at the DM's discretion).
The spell doesn't enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.

If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.

This spell can cause the plants created by the [*entangle*](../level-1/entangle.md) spell to release a **restrained** creature.

## Description
An area of elemental storm appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 120 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see.

When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud.
A bolt of lightning in the shape of a cylinder that is 120 feet tall with a 5-foot radius flashes down to that point.
Each creature within the bolt's area must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A creature takes this spell's lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.

The amount of damage that your lightning bolts deal depends on your surroundings.
When you cast this spell, choose the most powerful option available to you as listed from below.

### Command Storm
This option can only be chosen if weather conditions are right.
There must be a severe storm cloud in your immediate area, producing heavy precipitation and thunder, like a storm created by [*summon storm*](../level-3/summon-storm.md).
The cylinder of storm that you chose must also fit with no large obstructions blocking it, such as narrow walls or low ceilings.

If conditions are right, you seize the storm.
An ominous force of elemental energy fills the cylinder of storm that you chose.
For the duration, the scent of ozone fills the air; winds and clouds swirl unnaturally in the area.
This spell deals `4d10` lightning damage from lightning called from this elemental force.

### Fabricate Storm
This option can be chosen if the cylinder of storm you chose fits with no large obstructions blocking it, such as narrow walls or low ceilings.

A spiraling storm of dark clouds swirls into existance at the top of the cylinder of storm you chose.
This spell deals `3d10` lightning damage from lightning called from this elemental force.

### Aura of Static
If there is not enough room to accommodate the cylinder of storm, it fills as much of the area as it can with ambient static energy, which spreads around corners.

This spell deals `2d10` lightning damage from lightning called from this elemental force.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 3rd.

You make an area within range magically secure.
The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side.
The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.

When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:
- Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.
- The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.
- Sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.
- Creatures in the area can't be targeted by divination spells.
- Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.

## Description
You conjure up a sphere of water with a 5-foot radius at a point you can see within range.
The sphere can hover but no more than 10 feet off the ground.
The sphere remains for the spell's duration.

Any creature in the sphere's space must make a Strength Saving Throw.
On a successful save, a creature is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space of the creature's choice outside the sphere.
A *huge* or larger creature succeeds on the Saving Throw automatically, and a *large* or smaller creature can choose to fail it.
On a failed save, a creature is **restrained** by the sphere and is engulfed by the water.
At the end of each of its turns, a **restrained** target can repeat the Saving Throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The sphere can restrain as many as four *medium* or smaller creatures or one *large* creature.
If the sphere restrains a creature that causes it to exceed this capacity, a random creature that was already **restrained** by the sphere falls out of it and lands **prone** in a space within 5 feet of it.

As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line.
If it moves over a pit, a cliff, or other drop-off, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feet above the ground.
Any creature **restrained** by the sphere moves with it.
You can ram the sphere into creatures, forcing them to make the Saving Throw.

When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all normal flames within 30 feet of it.
Any creature **restrained** by the sphere is knocked **prone** in the space where it falls.
The water then vanishes.

- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, concentration

## Description
You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range.
It must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or be **charmed** by you for the duration.
If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the Saving Throw.

While the beast is **charmed**, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence.
You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey.
You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target.
Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do.
During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom Saving Throw against the spell.
If the Saving Throw succeeds, the spell ends.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell with a 5th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes.
When you use a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour.

- **Material Components:** a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant

---

## Description
You make natural terrain in a 150-foot-long cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain.
Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain.
A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.
Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed in appearance.

The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion.
If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence Ability Check against your Spell Save DC to disbelieve it.
A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.

The creature has the statistics provided in the Monster Manual for the chosen form, though it is a celestial, a fey, or a fiend (your choice) instead of its normal creature type.
Additionally, if it has an Intelligence Score of 5 or lower, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.

You control the mount in combat.
While the mount is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.
While mounted on it, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target the mount.

The mount disappears temporarily when it drops to 0 hit points or when you dismiss it as an action.

# Locate Creature

***4th-level divination***

- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Range:** self
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a bit of fur from a bloodhound

---

## Description
Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you.
You sense the direction to the creature's location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of you.
If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.

The spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature up close&mdash;within 30 feet&mdash;at least once.
If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a polymorph spell, this spell doesn't locate the creature.

This spell can't locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.

# Conjure Demon
- [x] Homebrew

***4th-level conjuration***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a vial of blood from a humanoid killed within the past 24 hours

---

## Description
You utter foul words, summoning one demon from the chaos of the Abyss.
You choose the demon's type, which must be one of challenge rating 5 or lower, such as a *shadow demon* or a *barlgura*.
The demon appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range, and the demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

Roll initiative for the demon, which has its own turns.
When you summon it and on each of your turns thereafter, you can issue a verbal command to it (requiring no action on your part), telling it what it must do on its next turn.
If you issue no command, it spends its turn attacking any creature within reach that has attacked it.

At the end of each of the demon's turns, it makes a Charisma Saving Throw.
The demon has disadvantage on this Saving Throw if you say its true name.
On a failed save, the demon continues to obey you.
On a successful save, your control of the demon ends for the rest of the duration, and the demon spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest non-demons to the best of its ability.
If you stop concentrating on the spell before it reaches its full duration, an uncontrolled demon doesn't disappear for `1d6` rounds if it still has hit points.

As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle on the ground with the blood used as a material component.
The circle is large enough to encompass your space.
While the spell lasts, the summoned demon can't cross the circle or harm it, and it can't target anyone within it.
Using the material component in this manner consumes it when the spell ends.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.

## Description
A huge, swirling storm of freezing gales (80 mph) and icy debris explodes into existence, centered on you.
The storm takes the shape of a 90-foot-radius cylinder that is 30 feet tall.
This storm has the following properties:
- It magically reduces the air temperature in the area by 5 degrees fahrenheit per round until the spell ends.
- It magically generates snow and hail, blanketing the surrounding area with the element of winter.
- It heavily obscures the area with blistering wind, snow, and icy debris.
- It makes you and all other creatures in its area **blinded** and **deafened**.
- It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area.
- It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind.
- Its area is difficult terrain.
- Any creature within the storm has disadvantage on all attacks and Ability Checks.
- Any creature that attacks something within or past the blizzard has disadvantage on its Attack Roll.
- Any creature that moves through the blizzard or ends its turn there must make a Strength Saving Throw.
	On a failure, the creature takes `1d6` bludgeoning damage, `2d6` cold damage, and falls prone.
	On a success, the creature takes half damage and doesn’t fall prone.

There are relatively few ways to end this spell early.
One such way is using magic, such as [*dispel magic*](../level-3/dispel-magic.md), to force the spell eto end.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, both the bludgeoning and cold damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 4th.

The target must then succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or become **stunned** until the end of your next turn.

Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round.

A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.

# Conjure Knowbot

## Description
You touch a single computerized device or computer system to conjure a knowbot&mdash;a partially sentient piece of software imprinted with vestiges of your own skills and computer abilities.
For the duration of the spell, you can use a bonus action to have the knowbot execute a computer-related task that would normally require an action.
The knowbot makes Intelligence Ability Checks using your ability score and proficiency bonuses (including your proficiency with hacking tools, if applicable).

You have a limited telepathic bond with the knowbot, out to a range of 500 feet from the device or system where the knowbot was conjured.
If you move beyond this range, the knowbot disappears in `2d4` rounds, as if the duration of the spell had expired.
Moving within range again immediately reestablishes the bond.

The knowbot is bound to the system in which it was created, and it stays there until it is dismissed or the spell's duration expires.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the spell's duration increases to 1 hour.
Additionally, your telepathic bond with the knowbot is effective out to a range of 1,000 feet, and if you leave the range of the bond, the knowbot continues performing its last directed task until the spell expires.

# Control Water
- [ ] Homebrew

***4th-level transmutation***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a drop of water and a pinch of dust

---

## Description
Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side.
You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell.
As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.

### Flood
You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet.
If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.

If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down.
Any *huge* or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side.
Any *huge* or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.

The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.
If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.

### Part Water
You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench.
The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side.
The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.
The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.

### Redirect Flow
You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions.
The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions.
The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.

### Whirlpool
This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep.
You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area.
The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall.
Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it.
A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength Ability Check against your Spell Save DC.

When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes `2d8` bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends.
On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex.
A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength Ability Check to do so.

The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes `2d8` bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.

Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it.
The target must make a Constitution Saving Throw.

This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the Saving Throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 4th.

## Description
A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of *large* size or smaller within range.

On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.

Nothing&mdash;not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects&mdash;can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there.
The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.

The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside.
An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's speed.
Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.

A [*disintegrate*](./disintegrate) spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.

You summon a *small* air elemental to a spot within range.
The air elemental is formless, nearly transparent, immune to all damage, and cannot interact with other creatures or objects.
It carries an open, empty chest whose interior dimensions are 3 feet on each side.
While the spell lasts, you can deposit as many items inside the chest as will fit.
You can then name a living creature you have met and seen at least once before, or any creature for which you possess a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the creature's body.

As soon as the lid of the chest is closed, the elemental and the chest disappear, then reappear adjacent to the target creature.
If the target creature is on another plane, or if it is proofed against magical detection or location, the contents of the chest reappear on the ground at your feet.

The target creature is made aware of the chest's contents before it chooses whether or not to open it, and knows how much of the spell's duration remains in which it can retrieve them.
No other creature can open the chest and retrieve its contents.
When the spell expires or when all the contents of the chest have been removed, the elemental and the chest disappear.
The elemental also disappears if the target creature orders it to return the items to you.
When the elemental disappears, any items not taken from the chest reappear on the ground at your feet.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using an 8th-level spell slot, you can send the chest to a creature on a different plane of existence from you.

| 2&mdash;6  | The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn. |

## Description
This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form.
An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom Saving Throw to avoid the effect.
The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.

The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies.
The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating).
The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast.
It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form.
When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed.
If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form.
As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked **unconscious**.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.

The target's gear melds into the new form.
The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

## Description
You create an invisible sensor within range that hovers in the air for the duration.

You mentally receive information from the sensor.
The amplified aspects of this sensor allow you to see all around it, smell subtle scents nearby, hear the slightest sounds, and even taste and feel objects close to the sensor if you choose to do so.
You can otherwise sense through the sensor as if you were in its space.

As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction.
There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can't enter another plane of existence.
A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can squeeze through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.

A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees a luminous orb about the size of your fist.
The orb has intricate designs on it akin to an eyeball.

The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle.

You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels.

## Description
Name or describe a person, place, or object.
The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named.
The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known.
If the thing you named isn't of legendary importance, you gain no information.
The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.

The information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language.
For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information: "Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones.
Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word Rudnogg on the lips."

## Description
With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service.
The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell.
(Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma Saving Throw.
On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration.
If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell's duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.

A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability.
You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message.
The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives.
If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence.
If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot.

## Description
You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days.
If the creature's soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.

This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died.
This spell doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren't first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life.
The spell can't return an undead creature to life.

This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts.
If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival&mdash;its head, for instance&mdash;the spell automatically fails.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal.
The target takes a −4 penalty to all Attack Rolls, Saving Throws, and Ability Checks.
Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

## Description
Uttering a dark incantation, you summon a devil from the Nine Hells.
You choose the devil's type, which must be one of challenge rating 6 or lower, such as a barbed devil or a bearded devil.
The devil appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range.
The devil disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The devil is unfriendly toward you and your companions.
Roll initiative for the devil, which has its own turns.
It is under the Dungeon Master's control and acts according to its nature on each of its turns, which might result in its attacking you if it thinks it can prevail, or trying to tempt you to undertake an evil act in exchange for limited service.
The DM has the creature's statistics.

On each of your turns, you can try to issue a verbal command to the devil (no action required by you).
It obeys the command if the likely outcome is in accordance with its desires, especially if the result would draw you toward evil.
Otherwise, it must Wisdom Saving Throw.
It makes the save with disadvantage if you say the devil's true name.
On a success, the devil becomes immune to your verbal commands for the duration of the spell, though it can still carry out your commands if it chooses.
On a failure, the devil carries out your command&mdash;such as "attack my enemies," "explore the room ahead," or "bear this message to the queen"&mdash;until it completes the activity, at which point it returns to you to report having done so.

If your concentration ends before the spell reaches its full duration, the devil doesn't disappear if it has become immune to your verbal commands.
Instead, it acts in whatever manner it chooses for `3d6` minutes, and then it disappears.

If you possess an individual devil's talisman, you can summon that devil if it is of the appropriate challenge rating plus 1, and it obeys all your commands, with no Charisma Ability Checks required.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.

- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, ritual
- **Material Components:** incense and a vial of holy or unholy water

---

## Description
You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no.
You must ask your questions before the spell ends.
You receive a correct answer for each question.

Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive "unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's knowledge.
In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.

If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.
The DM makes this roll in secret.

# Modify Memory
- [ ] Homebrew

***5th-level enchantment***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, concentration

---

## Description
You attempt to reshape another creature's memories.
One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the target becomes **charmed** by you for the duration.
The **charmed** target is **incapacitated** and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you.
If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target's memories are modified.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes.
You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.

You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root.
Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description.
If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered.
Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs.
An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream.
The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.

A [*remove curse*](./remove-curse) or [*greater restoration*](./greater-restoration) spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.

## At Higher Levels
If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature's past (9th level).

## Description
You take control of the air in a 100-foot-long cube that you can see within range.
Choose one of the following effects when you cast the spell.
The effect lasts for the spell's duration, unless you use your action on a later turn to switch to a different effect.
You can also use your action to temporarily halt the effect or to restart one you've halted.

### Gusts
A wind picks up within the cube, continually blowing in a horizontal direction you designate.
You choose the intensity of the wind: calm, moderate, or strong.
If the wind is moderate or strong, Ranged Weapon Attacks that pass through it or that are made against targets within the cube have disadvantage on their Attack Rolls.
If the wind is strong, any creature moving against the wind must spend 1 extra foot of movement for each foot moved.

### Downdraft
You cause a sustained blast of strong wind to blow downward from the top of the cube.
Ranged Weapon Attacks that pass through the cube or that are made against targets within it have disadvantage on their Attack Rolls.
A creature must make a Strength Saving Throw if it flies into the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there flying.
On a failed save, the creature is knocked **prone**.

### Updraft
You cause a sustained updraft within the cube, rising upward from the cube's bottom side.
Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from the fall.
When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to 10 feet higher than normal.

## Description
This spell shapes a creature's dreams.
Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell.
The target must be on the same plane of existence as you.
Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, can't be contacted by this spell.
You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger.
While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can't take actions or move.

If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target's dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell.
The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images.
The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early.
The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking.
If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target's dreams.

You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target.
If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target's sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest.
In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes `3d6` psychic damage.

If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target's body, the target makes its Saving Throw with disadvantage.

## Description
You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid.
Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body.
If the target's soul isn't free or willing to do so, the spell fails.

The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature's race to change.
The DM rolls a `d100` and consults the following table to determine what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the DM chooses a form.

| `d100`      | Race                |
|-------------|---------------------|
| 1&mdash;4   | Dragonborn          |

| 77&mdash;96 | Human               |
| 97&mdash;0  | Tiefling            |

The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences.
It retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it exchanges its original race for the new one and changes its racial traits accordingly.

- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, concentration

---

## Description
A tendril of inky darkness reaches out from you, touching a creature you can see within range to drain life from it.
The target must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
On a successful save, the target takes `2d8` necrotic damage, and the spell ends.
On a failed save, the target takes `4d8` necrotic damage, and until the spell ends, you can use your action on each of your turns to automatically deal `4d8` necrotic damage to the target.
The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else, if the target is ever outside the spell's range, or if the target has total cover from you.

Whenever the spell deals damage to a target, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage the target takes.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 5th.

# Seeming
- [ ] Homebrew

***5th-level illusion***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 8 hours
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic

---

## Description
This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range.
You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance.
An unwilling target can make a Charisma Saving Throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.

The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment.
You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between.
You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs.
Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection.
For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair.
If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence Ability Check against your Spell Save DC.
If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

# Teleportation Circle

- **Duration:** 1 round
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, material

---

## Description
As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you.
A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn.
Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines.
Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence&mdash;a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern.
When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the DM.
You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures.
You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.

You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year.
You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.

On a failure, you take `6d6` psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest.
While insane, you can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speak only in gibberish.
A [*greater restoration*](./greater-restoration) spell cast on you ends this effect.

On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions.
You must ask your questions before the spell ends.
The DM answers each question with one word, such as "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or "unclear" (if the entity doesn't know the answer to the question).
If a one-word answer would be misleading, the DM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.

The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know.
If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's.
Your DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.

The awakened beast or plant is **charmed** by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it.
When the **charmed** condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was **charmed**.

- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Tags:** verbal

---

## Description
You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide.
If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or become **charmed** by you for the duration.
While the creature is **charmed** by you, it takes `5d10` psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day.
A creature that can't understand you is unaffected by the spell.

You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death.
Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.

You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.
A [*remove curse*](./remove-curse), [*greater restoration*](./greater-restoration), or [*wish*](./wish) spell also ends it.

# Wall of Stone
- [ ] Homebrew

***5th-level evocation***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Shape:** wall
- **Height:** 10 feet
- **Length:** 100 feet
- **Width:** 6 inches
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a small block of granite

---

## Description
A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range.
The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels.
Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel.
Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.

If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice).
If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object.
The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation.
It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone.
Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.

If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports.
You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.

The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached.
Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness.
Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.

If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled.
Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.

| Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like | `–10`         |

On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this spell against it again for 24 hours.

On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target.
You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there.
The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration.
A creature that can see **invisible** objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.

Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell.
When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn't move.

| Material              | Duration   |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Vegetable matter      | 1 day      |
| Stone or crystal      | 12 hours   |
| Precious metals       | 1 hour     |
| Gems                  | 10 minutes |
| Adamantine or mithral | 1 minute   |

Using any material created by this spell as another spell's material component causes that spell to fail.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.

# Conjure Elemental
- [ ] Homebrew

***5th-level conjuration***
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** burning incense for air, soft clay for earth, sulfur and phosphorus for fire, or water and sand for water

---

## Description
You call forth an elemental servant.
Choose an area of air, earth, fire, or water that fills a 10-foot-long cube within range.
An elemental of challenge rating 5 or lower appropriate to the area you chose appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it.
For example, a fire elemental emerges from a bonfire, and an earth elemental rises up from the ground.
The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration.
Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns.
It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you).
If you don't issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

If your concentration is broken, the elemental doesn't disappear.
Instead, you lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack.
An uncontrolled elemental can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.

The DM has the elemental's statistics.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.

# Banishing Smite
- [x] Homebrew

***5th-level abjuration***
- **Casting Time:** bonus action
- **Duration:** 5 minutes
- **Range:** self
- **Tags:** verbal, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a weapon

---

## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
It begins to crackle with interplanar magic.
The weapon is considered magical for the duration (if it isn't already).
The first time you hit with a Weapon Attack using this weapon before the spell ends, it creates a volatile, interplanar portal that fills the target's space for a split second, and the spell ends.
The attack deals an extra `1d60` force damage in addition to the weapon's normal damage and effects.
The target must then succeed on a Charisma Saving Throw or be banished.
It has disadvantage on this Saving Throw if this attack reduces the target to 60 hit points or less.

A banished target vanishes, teleporting to another plane of existence.
If the target is native to a different plane than the one you're on, they return to their home plane.
Otherwise, the target randomly teleports to a different plane of existence.
In either case, the target arrives at a location in the plane that is safe enough for them to survive easily.

If you let go of the weapon, its magic dissipates, and the spell ends.
It also ends if you make a Ranged Attack with the weapon and miss.
Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).

Each time you make such a Ranged Attack, your quiver magically replaces the piece of ammunition you used with a similar piece of nonmagical ammunition.
Any pieces of ammunition created by this spell disintegrate when the spell ends.
If the quiver leaves your possession, the spell ends.

- **Material Components:** clay and water

---

## Description
You choose an area of stone or mud that you can see that fits within a 40-foot-long cube and is within range, and choose one of the following effects.

### Transmute Rock to Mud
Nonmagical rock of any sort in the area becomes an equal volume of thick, flowing mud that remains for the spell's duration.

The ground in the spell's area becomes muddy enough that creatures can sink into it.
Each foot that a creature moves through the mud costs 4 feet of movement, and any creature on the ground when you cast the spell must make a Strength Saving Throw.
A creature must also make the Saving Throw when it moves into the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
On a failed save, a creature sinks into the mud and is **restrained**, though it can use an action to end the **restrained** condition on itself by pulling itself free of the mud.

If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the mud falls.
Any creature under the mud when it falls must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A creature takes `4d8` bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Transmute Mud to Rock
Nonmagical mud or quicksand in the area no more than 10 feet deep transforms into soft stone for the spell's duration.
Any creature in the mud when it transforms must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
On a successful save, a creature is shunted safely to the surface in an unoccupied space.
On a failed save, a creature becomes **restrained** by the rock.
A **restrained** creature, or another creature within reach, can use an action to try to break the rock by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength Ability Check or by dealing damage to it.
The rock has AC 15 and 25 hit points, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.

# Dominate Person
- [ ] Homebrew

- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, concentration

---

## Description
You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range.
It must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or be **charmed** by you for the duration.
If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the Saving Throw.

While the target is **charmed**, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence.
You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey.
You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target.
Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do.
During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom Saving Throw against the spell.
If the Saving Throw succeeds, the spell ends.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes.
When you use a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour.
When you use a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time.
If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.

You can try to move a *huge* or smaller creature.
Make an Ability Check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature's Strength Ability Check.
If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell.
Until the end of your next turn, the creature is **restrained** in your telekinetic grip.
A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.

On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.

### Object
You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds.
If the object isn't being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.

If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an Ability Check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature's Strength Ability Check.
If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.

You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.

# Animate Objects
- [ ] Homebrew

***5th-level transmutation***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Instances:** 10
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, concentration

---

## Description
Objects come to life at your command.
Choose up to ten nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried.
*Medium* targets count as two objects, *large* targets count as four objects, *huge* targets count as eight objects.
You can't animate any object larger than *huge*.
Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.

As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one).
You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor.
If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures.
Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

| Size     | HP | AC | Attack                         | Str  | Dex  |
|----------|----|----|--------------------------------|------|------|
| *tiny*   | 20 | 18 | `+8` to hit, `1d4 + 4` damage  | `–3` | `+4` |
| *small*  | 25 | 16 | `+6` to hit, `1d8 + 2` damage  | `–2` | `+2` |
| *medium* | 40 | 13 | `+5` to hit, `2d6 + 1` damage  | `±0` | `+1` |
| *large*  | 50 | 10 | `+6` to hit, `2d10 + 2` damage | `+2` | `±0` |
| *huge*   | 80 | 10 | `+8` to hit, `2d12 + 4` damage | `+4` | `–3` |

An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size.
Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1.
Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover.
If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0.
It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance.
When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.

If you command an object to attack, it can make a single Melee Attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.
It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size.
The DM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.

## At Higher Levels
If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 5th.

## Description
You create a *large* hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range.
The hand lasts for the spell's duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum.
If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.
It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0).
The hand doesn't fill its space.

When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.

### Clenched Fist
The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it.
Make a Melee Spell Attack for the hand using your game statistics.
On a hit, the target takes `4d8` force damage.

### Forceful Hand
The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose.
Make a check with the hand's Strength contested by the Strength Ability Check of the target.
If the target is *medium* or smaller, you have advantage on the check.
If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your Spellcasting Ability Modifier.
The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.

### Grasping Hand
The hand attempts to grapple a *huge* or smaller creature within 5 feet of it.
You use the hand's Strength Score to resolve the grapple.
If the target is *medium* or smaller, you have advantage on the check.
While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it.
When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to `2d6` + your Spellcasting Ability Modifier.

### Interposing Hand
The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command.
The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target.
The target can't move through the hand's space if its Strength Score is less than or equal to the hand's Strength Score.
If its Strength Score is higher than the hand's Strength Score, the target can move toward you through the hand's space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by `2d8` and the damage from the grasping hand increases by `2d6` for each slot level above 5th.

# Conjure Vrock (UA)

- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a gem worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes

---

## Description
You summon a vrock that appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range.
The vrock disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The vrock's attitude depends on the value of the gem used as a material component for this spell.
Roll initiative for the vrock, which has its own turns.
At the start of the vrock's turn, the DM makes a secret Charisma Ability Check on your behalf, with a bonus equal to the gem's value divided by 20.
The check DC starts at 10 and increases by 2 each round.
You can issue orders to the vrock and have it obey you as long as you succeed on the Charisma Ability Check.

If the check fails, the spell no longer requires concentration and the vrock is no longer under your control.
The vrock takes no actions on its next turn and uses its telepathy to tell any creature it can see that it will fight in exchange for treasure.
The creature that gives the vrock the most expensive gem can command it for the next `1d6` rounds.
At the end of that time, it offers the bargain again.
If no one offers the vrock treasure before its next turn begins, it attacks the nearest creatures for `1d6` rounds before returning to the Abyss.

As part of casting the spell, you can scribe a circle on the ground using the blood of an intelligent humanoid slain within the past 24 hours.
The circle is large enough to encompass your space.
The summoned vrock cannot cross the circle or target anyone in it while the spell lasts.

- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** a gem, crystal, reliquary, or some other ornamental container worth at least 500 gp

---

## Description
Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell's material component.
While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container's space.
You can't move or use reactions.
The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoids body.

You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a protection from evil and good or magic circle spell can't be possessed).
The target must make a Charisma Saving Throw.
On a failure, your soul moves into the target's body, and the target's soul becomes trapped in the container.
On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can't attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.

Once you possess a creature's body, you control it.
Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma Scores.
You retain the benefit of your own class features.
If the target has any class levels, you can't use any of its class features.

Meanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can't move or take actions at all.

While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature's soul to its body.
If the host body dies while you're in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma Saving Throw against your own spellcasting DC.
On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you.
Otherwise, you die.

If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body.
If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die.
If another creature's soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet.
Otherwise, that creature dies.

When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

# Soul Cage
- [ ] Homebrew

***6th-level necromancy***
- **Casting Time:** reaction (which you take when a humanoid you can see within 60 feet of you dies)
- **Duration:** 8 hours
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** a tiny silver cage worth 100 gp

---

## Description
This spell snatches the soul of a humanoid as it dies and traps it inside the tiny cage you use for the material component.
A stolen soul remains inside the cage until the spell ends or until you destroy the cage, which ends the spell.
While you have a soul inside the cage, you can exploit it in any of the ways described below.
You can use a trapped soul up to six times.
Once you exploit a soul for the sixth time, it is released, and the spell ends.
While a soul is trapped, the dead humanoid it came from can't be revived.

### Steal Life
You can use a bonus action to drain vigor from the soul and regain `2d8` hit points.

### Query Soul
You ask the soul a question (no action required) and receive a brief telepathic answer, which you can understand regardless of the language used.
The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability.
The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.

### Borrow Experience
You can use a bonus action to bolster yourself with the soul's life experience, making your next Attack Roll, Ability Check, or Saving Throw with advantage.
If you don't use this benefit before the start of your next turn, it is lost.

### Eyes of the Dead
You can use an action to name a place the humanoid saw in life, which creates an invisible sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the plane of existence you're currently on.
The sensor remains for as long as you concentrate, up to 10 minutes (as if you were concentrating on a spell).
You receive visual and auditory information from the sensor as if you were in its space using your senses.

A creature that can see the sensor (such as one using [*see invisibility*](./see-invisibility) or truesight) sees a translucent image of the tormented humanoid whose soul you caged.

Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is **incapacitated** and can't move.
Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.

If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely.
If it can't land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.

## Description
Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you.
You cast that spell&mdash;called the contingent spell&mdash;as part of casting contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect.
Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs.
You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells.
For example, a contingency cast with water breathing might stipulate that water breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.

The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then contingency ends.

The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others.
You can use only one contingency spell at a time.
If you cast this spell again, the effect of another contingency spell on you ends.
Also, contingency ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.

When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose.
You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.

Guards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area.

### Corridors
Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured.
In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.

### Doors
All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an [*arcane lock*](./arcane-lock) spell.
In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the minor illusion spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.

### Stairs
Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the [*web*](./web) spell.
These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts.

### Other Spell Effect
You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.

	You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.

The whole warded area radiates magic.
A [*dispel magic*](./dispel-magic) cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.

You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.

Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet.
The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target the ground under a creature if that creature is *medium* or smaller.
Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points.
When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10-foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared.
Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or be lifted by the pillar.
A creature can choose to fail the save.

If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes `6d6` bludgeoning damage and is **restrained**, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle.
The **restrained** creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity Ability Check (the creature's choice) against your Spell Save DC.

## Description
Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range.
You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration.
You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar.
The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension.
So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on.
It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.

At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.

Because the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can't usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movement.

This spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone construction.
Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain.
If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.

Similarly, this spell doesn't directly affect plant growth.
The moved earth carries any plants along with it.

- **Height:** 10 feet
- **Length:** 100 feet
- **Width:** 1 foot
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a small piece of quartz

## Description
You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range.
You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels.
Each panel must be contiguous with another panel.
In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.

If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes `10d6` cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached.
It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage.
Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied.
A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
That creature takes `5d6` cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by `2d6`, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by `1d6`, for each slot level above 6th.

- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** an ointment for the eyes that costs 25 gp; is made from mushroom powder, saffron, and fat; and is consumed by the spell

---

# Create Undead
- [ ] Homebrew

***6th-level necromancy***
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Duration:** instantaneous
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** one clay pot filled with grave dirt, one clay pot filled with brackish water, and one 150 gp black onyx stone for each corpse

---

## Description
You can cast this spell only at night.
Choose up to three corpses of *medium* or *small* humanoids within range.
Each corpse becomes a ghoul under your control.
(The DM has game statistics for these creatures.)

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one).
You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor.
If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures.
Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it.
To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends.
This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four ghouls.
When you cast this spell using an 8th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five ghouls or two ghasts or wights.
When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over six ghouls, three ghasts or wights, or two mummies.

# Heroes' Feast
- [ ] Homebrew

***6th-level conjuration***
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Duration:** instantaneous
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Instances:** 12
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** a gem-encrusted bowl worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes

---

## Description
You bring forth a great feast, including magnificent food and drink.
The feast takes 1 hour to consume and disappears at the end of that time, and the beneficial effects don't set in until this hour is over.
Up to twelve creatures can partake of the feast.

A creature that partakes of the feast gains several benefits.
The creature is cured of all diseases and poison, becomes immune to poison and being **frightened**, and makes all Wisdom Saving Throws with advantage.
Its hit point maximum also increases by `2d10`, and it gains the same number of hit points.
These benefits last for 24 hours.

# Mass Suggestion
- [ ] Homebrew

***6th-level enchantment***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 day
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Instances:** 12
- **Tags:** verbal, material
- **Material Components:** a snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil

---

## Description
You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you.
Creatures that can't be **charmed** are immune to this effect.
The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable.
Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.

Each target must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability.
The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration.
If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration.
For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet.
If the condition isn't met before the spell ends, the activity isn't performed.

If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 10 days.
When you use an 8th-level spell slot, the duration is 30 days.
When you use a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is a year and a day.

***6th-level abjuration***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Range:** self
- **Shape:** sphere
- **Radius:** 10 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a glass or crystal bead that shatters when the spell ends

---

## Description
An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.

Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot.
Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them.
Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.

# Arcane Gate
- [ ] Homebrew

***6th-level conjuration***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 500 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, concentration

---

## Description
You create linked teleportation portals that remain open for the duration.
Choose two points on the ground that you can see, one point within 10 feet of you and one point within 500 feet of you.
A circular portal, 10 feet in diameter, opens over each point.
If the portal would open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and the casting is lost.

The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and perpendicular to it at the points you choose.
A ring is visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side that functions as a portal.

Any creature or object entering the portal exits from the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side has no effect.
The mist that fills each portal is opaque and blocks vision through it.
On your turn, you can rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side faces in a different direction.

# Drawmij's Instant Summons
- [ ] Homebrew

***6th-level conjuration***
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Duration:** indefinate
- **Range:** touch
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, ritual
- **Material Components:** a sapphire worth 1,000 gp

---

## Description
You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 feet or less.
The spell leaves an invisible mark on its surface and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the material component.
Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.

At any time thereafter, you can use your action to speak the item's name and crush the sapphire.
The item instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.

If another creature is holding or carrying the item, crushing the sapphire doesn't transport the item to you, but instead you learn who the creature possessing the object is and roughly where that creature is located at that moment.

[*Dispel magic*](./dispel-magic) or a similar effect successfully applied to the sapphire ends this spell's effect.

# Investiture of Ice

***6th-level transmutation***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** self
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, concentration

## Description
Until the spell ends, ice rimes your body, and you gain the following benefits:
- You are immune to cold damage and have resistance to fire damage.
- You can move across difficult terrain created by ice or snow without spending extra movement.
- The ground in a 10-foot radius around you is icy and is difficult terrain for creatures other than you.
	The radius moves with you.
- You can use your action to create a 15-foot cone of freezing wind extending from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose.
	Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
	A creature takes `4d6` cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	A creature that fails its save against this effect has its speed halved until the start of your next turn.

# Programmed Illusion
- [ ] Homebrew

***6th-level illusion***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** indefinate
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 gp

---

## Description
You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs.
The illusion is imperceptible until then.
It must be no larger than a 30-foot-long cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes.
This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.

When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described.
Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes.
After this time, the illusion can be activated again.

The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area.
For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.
A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence Ability Check against your Spell Save DC.
If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

# Planar Ally
- [ ] Homebrew

***6th-level conjuration***
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Duration:** instantaneous
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic

---

## Description
You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid.
The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power.
That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range.
If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice).

When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way.
You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so.
The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon).
You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.

Payment can take a variety of forms.
A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure.
Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.

As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute.
A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour.
And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day.
The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell.
If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived.
Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift.
Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.

After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible.
If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.

A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.

# Druid Grove
- [ ] Homebrew

***6th-level abjuration***
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Duration:** 1 day
- **Range:** touch
- **Shape:** cube
- **Length:** 90 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** mistletoe, which the spell consumes, that was harvested with a golden sickle under the light of a full moon

---

## Description
You invoke the spirits of nature to protect an area outdoors or underground.
The area can be as small as a 30-foot-long cube or as large as a 90-foot-long cube.
Buildings and other structures are excluded from the affected area.
If you cast this spell in the same area every day for a year, the spell lasts until dispelled.

The spell creates the following effects within the area.
When you cast this spell, you can specify creatures as friends who are immune to the effects.
You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.

The entire warded area radiates magic.
A dispel magic cast on the area, if successful, removes only one of the following effects, not the entire area.
That spell's caster chooses which effect to end.
Only when all its effects are gone is this spell dispelled.

### Solid Fog
You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground with thick fog, making them heavily obscured.
The fog reaches 10 feet high.
In addition, every foot of movement through the fog costs 2 extra feet.
To a creature immune to this effect, the fog obscures nothing and looks like soft mist, with motes of green light floating in the air.

### Grasping Undergrowth
You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground that aren't filled with fog with grasping weeds and vines, as if they were affected by an entangle spell.
To a creature immune to this effect, the weeds and vines feel soft and reshape themselves to serve as temporary seats or beds.

### Grove Guardians
You can animate up to four trees in the area, causing them to uproot themselves from the ground.
These trees have the same statistics as an awakened tree, which appears in the Monster Manual, except they can't speak, and their bark is covered with druidic symbols.
If any creature not immune to this effect enters the warded area, the grove guardians fight until they have driven off or slain the intruders.
The grove guardians also obey your spoken commands (no action required by you) that you issue while in the area.
If you don't give them commands and no intruders are present, the grove guardians do nothing.
The grove guardians can't leave the warded area.
When the spell ends, the magic animating them disappears, and the trees take root again if possible.

### Additional Spell Effect
You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area:
- A constant gust of wind in two locations of your choice
- Spike growth in one location of your choice
- Wind wall in two locations of your choice

To a creature immune to this effect, the winds are a fragrant, gentle breeze, and the area of spike growth is harmless.

## Description
Until the spell ends, wind whirls around you, and you gain the following benefits:
- Ranged Weapon Attacks made against you have disadvantage on the Attack Roll.
- You gain a flying speed of 60 feet.
	If you are still flying when the spell ends, you fall, unless you can somehow prevent it.
- You can use your action to create a 15-foot-long cube of swirling wind centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you.
	Each creature in that area must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
	A creature takes `2d10` bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	If a *large* or smaller creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up to 10 feet away from the center of the cube.

# Find the Path

- **Range:** self
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a set of divinatory tools&mdash;such as bones, ivory sticks, cards, teeth, or carved runes&mdash;worth 100 gp and an object from the location you wish to find

---

## Description
This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane of existence.
If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn't specific (such as "a green dragon's lair"), the spell fails.

For the duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies.
While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to the destination.

# Create Homunculus
- [ ] Homebrew

***6th-level transmutation***
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Duration:** instantaneous
- **Range:** touch
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** clay, ash, and mandrake root, all of which the spell consumes, and a jewel-encrusted dagger worth at least 1,000 gp

---

## Description
While speaking an intricate incantation, you cut yourself with a jewel-encrusted dagger, taking `2d4` piercing damage that can't be reduced in any way.
You then drip your blood on the spell's other components and touch them, transforming them into a special construct called a homunculus.

The statistics of the homunculus are in the Monster Manual.
It is your faithful companion, and it dies if you die.
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can spend up to half your Hit Dice if the homunculus is on the same plane of existence as you.
When you do so, roll each die and add your Constitution modifier to it.
Your hit point maximum is reduced by the total, and the homunculus's hit point maximum and current hit points are both increased by it.
This process can reduce you to no lower than 1 hit point, and the change to your and the homunculus's hit points ends when you finish your next long rest.
The reduction to your hit point maximum can't be removed by any means before then, except by the homunculus's death.

You can have only one homunculus at a time.
If you cast this spell while your homunculus lives, the spell fails.

## Description
You summon a fey creature of challenge rating 6 or lower, or a fey spirit that takes the form of a beast of challenge rating 6 or lower.
It appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range.
The fey creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The fey creature is friendly to you and your companions for the duration.
Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns.
It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you), as long as they don't violate its alignment.
If you don't issue any commands to the fey creature, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

If your concentration is broken, the fey creature doesn't disappear.
Instead, you lose control of the fey creature, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack.
An uncontrolled fey creature can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.

The DM has the fey creature's statistics.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 6th.

A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line.
Each creature in the line must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes `6d8` radiant damage and is **blinded** until your next turn.
On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't **blinded** by this spell.
Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this Saving Throw.

You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.

For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand.
It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
This light is sunlight.

---

## Description
You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didn't die of old age, and that isn't undead.
If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.

This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died.
It doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren't removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.

This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal.
The target takes a −4 penalty to all Attack Rolls, Saving Throws, and Ability Checks.
Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly.
Until you finish a long rest, you can't cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all Attack Rolls, Ability Checks, and Saving Throws.

# Teleport

***7th-level conjuration***
- **Casting Time:** action

- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Tags:** verbal

---

## Description
This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select.
If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot-long cube, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.

The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you.
Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully.
The DM rolls `d100` and consults the table.

| Familiarity       | Mishap      | Similar Area | Off Target  | On Target    |
|-------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| Permanent circle  | &mdash;     | &mdash;      | &mdash;     | 01&ndash;100 |
| Associated object | &mdash;     | &mdash;      | &mdash;     | 01&ndash;100 |
| Very familiar     | 01&ndash;05 | 06&ndash;13  | 14&ndash;24 | 25&ndash;100 |
| Seen casually     | 01&ndash;33 | 34&ndash;43  | 44&ndash;53 | 54&ndash;100 |
| Viewed once       | 01&ndash;43 | 44&ndash;53  | 54&ndash;73 | 74&ndash;100 |
| Description       | 01&ndash;43 | 44&ndash;53  | 54&ndash;73 | 74&ndash;100 |
| False destination | 01&ndash;50 | 51&ndash;100 | &mdash;     | &mdash;      |

### Familiarity
"Permanent circle" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know.
"Associated object" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb.

"Very familiar" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell.
"Seen casually" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar.
"Viewed once" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic.
"Description" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.

"False destination" is a place that doesn't exist.
Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.

### On Target
You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.

### Off Target
You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction.
Distance off target is `1d10 × 1d10` percent of the distance that was to be traveled.
For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two `d10`s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles.
The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a `d8` and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass.
If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.

### Similar Area
You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area.
If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory.
Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.

### Mishap
The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey.
Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes `3d10` force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).

# Delayed Blast Fireball
- [ ] Homebrew

***7th-level evocation***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Shape:** sphere
- **Radius:** 20 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur

---

## Description
A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration.
When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners.
Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The spell's base damage is `12d6`.
If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by `1d6`.

If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame.
On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet.
When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.

The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 7th.

# Temple of the Gods
- [ ] Homebrew

***7th-level conjuration***
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Duration:** 1 day
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** a holy symbol worth at least 5 gp

---

## Description
You cause a temple to shimmer into existence on ground you can see within range.
The temple must fit within an unoccupied cube of space, up to 120 feet on each side.
The temple remains until the spell ends.
It is dedicated to whatever god, pantheon, or philosophy is represented by the holy symbol used in the casting.

You make all decisions about the temple's appearance.
The interior is enclosed by a floor, walls, and a roof, with one door granting access to the interior and as many windows as you wish.
Only you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open or close the door.

The temple's interior is an open space with an idol or altar at one end.
You decide whether the temple is illuminated and whether that illumination is bright light or dim light.
The smell of burning incense fills the air within, and the temperature is mild.

The temple opposes types of creatures you choose when you cast this spell.
Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead.
If a creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must make a Charisma Saving Throw.
On a failed save, it can't enter the temple for 24 hours.
Even if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; whenever it makes an Attack Roll, an Ability Check, or a Saving Throw inside the temple, it must roll a `d4` and subtract the number rolled from the `d20` roll.

In addition, the sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the temple, and creatures within can't be targeted by divination spells.

Finally, whenever any creature in the temple regains hit points from a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 hit point).

The temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple's interior.
Nothing can physically pass through the temple's exterior.
It can't be dispelled by dispel magic, and antimagic field has no effect on it.
A [*disintegrate*](./disintegrate) spell destroys the temple instantly.

Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.

# Power Word Pain
- [ ] Homebrew

***7th-level enchantment***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** instantaneous
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Tags:** verbal

---

## Description
You speak a word of power that causes waves of intense pain to assail one creature you can see within range.
If the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it is subject to crippling pain.
Otherwise, the spell has no effect on it.
A target is also unaffected if it is immune to being **charmed**.

While the target is affected by crippling pain, any speed it has can be no higher than 10 feet.
The target also has disadvantage on Attack Rolls, Ability Checks, and Saving Throws, other than Constitution Saving Throws.
Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted.

A target suffering this pain can make a Constitution Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns.
On a successful save, the pain ends.

# Project Image

***7th-level illusion***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 day
- **Range:** 500 miles
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a small replica of you made from materials worth at least 5 gp

---

## Description
You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration.
The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles.
The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible.
If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.

You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.
It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space.
On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again.
While you are using its senses, you are **blinded** and **deafened** in regard to your own surroundings.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.
A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence Ability Check against your Spell Save DC.
If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn't grow older.

You can set a condition for the spell to end early.
The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target.

# Conjure Hezrou (UA)
- [ ] Homebrew

***7th-level conjuration***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** food worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes

---

## Description
You summon a hezrou that appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range.
The hezrou disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The hezrou's attitude depends on the value of the food used as a material component for this spell.
Roll initiative for the hezrou, which has its own turns.
At the start of the hezrou's turn, the DM makes a secret Charisma Ability Check on your behalf, with a bonus equal to the food's value divided by 20.
The check DC starts at 10 and increases by 2 each round.
You can issue orders to the hezrou and have it obey you as long as you succeed on the Charisma Ability Check.

If the check fails, the spell no longer requires concentration and the demon is no longer under your control.
The hezrou then focuses on devouring any corpses it can see.
If there are no such meals at hand, it attacks the nearest creatures and eats anything it kills.
If its hit points are reduced to below half its hit point maximum, it returns to the Abyss.

As part of casting the spell, you can scribe a circle on the ground using the blood of an intelligent humanoid slain within the past 24 hours.
The circle is large enough to encompass your space.
The summoned hezrou cannot cross the circle or target anyone in it while the spell lasts.

# Symbol
- [ ] Homebrew

***7th-level abjuration***
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Duration:** activated
- **Range:** touch
- **Shape:** sphere
- **Radius:** 5 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** mercury, phosphorus, and powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes

---

## Description
When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest).
If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter.
If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence Ability Check against your Spell Save DC to find it.

You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell.
For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it.
For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.

You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers).
You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect.
Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends.
Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

### Death
Each target must make a Constitution Saving Throw, taking `10d10` necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.

### Discord
Each target must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute.
During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on Attack Rolls and Ability Checks.

### Fear
Each target must make a Wisdom Saving Throw and becomes **frightened** for 1 minute on a failed save.
While **frightened**, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.

### Hopelessness
Each target must make a Charisma Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute.
During this time, it can't attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.

### Insanity
Each target must make an Intelligence Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute.
An insane creature can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish.
The DM controls its movement, which is erratic.

### Pain
Each target must make a Constitution Saving Throw and becomes **incapacitated** with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.

### Sleep
Each target must make a Wisdom Saving Throw and falls **unconscious** for 10 minutes on a failed save.
A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.

### Stunning
Each target must make a Wisdom Saving Throw and becomes **stunned** for 1 minute on a failed save.

- **Length:** 20 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** ruby dust worth 1,500 gp

---

## Description
An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range.
The prison can be a cage or a solid box as you choose.

A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from &frac12;-inch diameter bars spaced &frac12; inch apart.

A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.

When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped.
Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.

A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means.
If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma Saving Throw.
On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage.
On a failure, the creature can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect.
The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

This spell can't be dispelled by [*dispel magic*](./dispel-magic).

# Simulacrum

- **Duration:** indefinate
- **Range:** touch
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** snow or ice in quantities sufficient to made a life-size copy of the duplicated creature; some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of that creature's body placed inside the snow or ice; and powdered ruby worth 1,500 gp, sprinkled over the duplicate and consumed by the spell

---

## Description
You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell.
The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature.
It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature's hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment.
Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates, except that it is a construct.

The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate.
It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat.
The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.

If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains.
The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.

If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed.

This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range.
All creatures and objects that aren't somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell.
A creature can make a Dexterity Saving Throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.

If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall.
If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.

At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.

## Description
You utter a divine word, imbued with the power that shaped the world at the dawn of creation.
Choose any number of creatures you can see within range.
Each creature that can hear you must make a Charisma Saving Throw.
On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect based on its current hit points:
- 50 hit points or fewer: **deafened** for 1 minute
- 40 hit points or fewer: **deafened** and **blinded** for 10 minutes
- 30 hit points or fewer: **blinded**, **deafened**, and **stunned** for 1 hour

Regardless of its current hit points, a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend that fails its save is forced back to its plane of origin (if it isn't there already) and can't return to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a [*wish*](./wish) spell.

If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends.
If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the **petrified** condition.
The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive, keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

### 7-Violet
On a failed save, the target is **blinded**.
It must then make a Wisdom Saving Throw at the start of your next turn.
A successful save ends the blindness.
If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the DM's choosing and is no longer **blinded**.
(Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)

### 8-Special

Roll twice more, rerolling any 8.

## Description
A whirlwind howls down to a point that you can see on the ground within range.
The whirlwind is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on that point.
Until the spell ends, you can use your action to move the whirlwind up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground.
The whirlwind sucks up any *medium* or smaller objects that aren't secured to anything and that aren't worn or carried by anyone.

A creature must make a Dexterity Saving Throw the first time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind or that the whirlwind enters its space, including when the whirlwind first appears.
A creature takes `10d6` bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
In addition, a *large* or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or become **restrained** in the whirlwind until the spell ends.
When a creature starts its turn **restrained** by the whirlwind, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside it, unless the creature is at the top.
A **restrained** creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the spell ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft.

A **restrained** creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity Ability Check against your Spell Save DC.
If successful, the creature is no longer **restrained** by the whirlwind and is hurled `3d6 × 10` feet away from it in a random direction.

- **Instances:** 9
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** a forked, metal rod worth at least 250 gp, attuned to a particular plane of existence

---

## Description
You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence.
You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination.
If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM's discretion.

Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle.
If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.

You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane.
Choose a creature within your reach and make a Melee Spell Attack against it.
On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma Saving Throw.
If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify.
A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.

- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon, each item worth at least 5 gp

---

## Description
You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the duration.
You choose where its one entrance is located.
The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall.
You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open.
You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it.
While closed, the portal is invisible.

Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond.
The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.

You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can't exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side.
The place is furnished and decorated as you choose.
It contains sufficient food to serve a nine course banquet for up to 100 people.
A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter.
You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire.
They are completely obedient to your orders.
Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature.
Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on.
The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can't leave it.
Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion.
When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.

# Etherealness

***7th-level transmutation***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 8 hours

- **Tags:** verbal, somatic

## Description
You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area where it overlaps with your current plane.
You remain in the Border Ethereal for the duration or until you use your action to dismiss the spell.
During this time, you can move in any direction.
If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot.
You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and you can't see anything more than 60 feet away.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane.
Creatures that aren't on the Ethereal Plane can't perceive you and can't interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so.

You ignore all objects and effects that aren't on the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from.

When the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated from in the spot you currently occupy.
If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.

This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn't border it, such as one of the Outer Planes.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can target up to three willing creatures (including you) for each slot level above 7th.
The creatures must be within 10 feet of you when you cast the spell.

# Fire Storm
- [ ] Homebrew

***7th-level evocation***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** instantaneous
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Shape:** cube
- **Length:** 10 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic

## Description
A storm made up of sheets of roaring flame appears in a location you choose within range.
The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot-long cubes, which you can arrange as you wish.
Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube.

# Mirage Arcane
- [ ] Homebrew

***7th-level illusion***
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Duration:** 10 days
- **Range:** unlimited
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic

---

## Description
You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain.
The terrain's general shape remains the same, however.
Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain.
A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.

Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present.
The spell doesn't disguise, conceal, or add creatures.

The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area.
Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell's area disappears immediately.

Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain's true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.

On a hit, the target takes `4d12` radiant damage.
Whether you hit or miss, the mote is expended.

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Duration:** instantaneous

- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes

## Description
A fortress of stone erupts from a square area of ground of your choice that you can see within range.
The area is 120 feet on each side, and it must not have any buildings or other structures on it.
Any creatures in the area are harmlessly lifted up as the fortress rises.

The fortress has four turrets with square bases, each one 20 feet on a side and 30 feet tall, with one turret on each corner.
The turrets are connected to each other by stone walls that are each 80 feet long, creating an enclosed area.
Each wall is 1 foot thick and is composed of panels that are 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall.
Each panel is contiguous with two other panels or one other panel and a turret.
You can place up to four stone doors in the fortress's outer wall.

A small keep stands inside the enclosed area.
The keep has a square base that is 50 feet on each side, and it has three floors with 10-foot-high ceilings.
Each of the floors can be divided into as many rooms as you like, provided each room is at least 5 feet on each side.
The floors of the keep are connected by stone staircases, its walls are 6 inches thick, and interior rooms can have stone doors or open archways as you choose.
The keep is furnished and decorated however you like, and it contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people each day.
Furnishings, food, and other objects created by this spell crumble to dust if removed from the fortress.

A staff of one hundred invisible servants obeys any command given to them by creatures you designate when you cast the spell.
Each servant functions as if created by the unseen servant spell.

The walls, turrets, and keep are all made of stone that can be damaged.
Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of stone has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness.
It is immune to poison and psychic damage.
Reducing a section of stone to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected sections to buckle and collapse at the DM's discretion.

After 7 days or when you cast this spell somewhere else, the fortress harmlessly crumbles and sinks back into the ground, leaving any creatures that were inside it safely on the ground.

Casting this spell on the same spot once every 7 days for a year makes the fortress permanent.

The darkness spreads around corners.
A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness.
Non-magical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can't illuminate the area.

Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere.

# Clone
- [ ] Homebrew

***8th-level necromancy***
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Duration:** instantaneous
- **Range:** touch
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp and at least 1 cubic inch of flesh of the creature that is to be cloned, which the spell consumes, and a vessel worth at least 2,000 gp that has a sealable lid and is large enough to hold a *medium* creature, such as a huge urn, coffin, mud-filled cyst in the ground, or crystal container filled with salt water

---

## Description
This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living, *medium* creature as a safeguard against death.
This clone forms inside a sealed vessel and grows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger version of the same creature.
It remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.

At any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing to return.
The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original's equipment.
The original creature's physical remains, if they still exist, become inert and can't thereafter be restored to life, since the creature's soul is elsewhere.

# Antipathy/Sympathy
- [ ] Homebrew

***8th-level enchantment***
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Duration:** 10 days
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Shape:** cube
- **Length:** 200 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the antipathy effect or a drop of honey for the sympathy effect

---

## Description
This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice.
You target something within range, either a *huge* or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot-long cube.
Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires.
You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration.
Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.

### Antipathy
The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target.
When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or become **frightened**.
The creature remains **frightened** while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it.
While **frightened** by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target.
If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer **frightened**, but the creature becomes **frightened** again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.

### Sympathy
The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it.
When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target.
When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from the target.

If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom Saving Throw to end the effect, as described below.

### Ending the Effect
If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom Saving Throw.
On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical.
In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom Saving Throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.

A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.

## Description
A wall of water springs into existence at a point you choose within range.
You can make the wall up to 300 feet long, 300 feet high, and 50 feet thick.
The wall lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength Saving Throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes `6d10` bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

At the start of each of your turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it, moves 50 feet away from you.
Any *huge* or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or take `5d10` bludgeoning damage.
A creature can take this damage only once per round.
At the end of the turn, the wall's height is reduced by 50 feet, and the damage creatures take from the spell on subsequent rounds is reduced by `1d10`.
When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the spell ends.

A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming.
Because of the force of the wave, though, the creature must make a successful Strength Ability Check against your Spell Save DC in order to move at all.
If it fails the check, it can't move.
A creature that moves out of the area falls to the ground.

# Dominate Monster
- [ ] Homebrew

***8th-level enchantment***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, concentration

---

## Description
You attempt to beguile a creature that you can see within range.
It must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or be **charmed** by you for the duration.
If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the Saving Throw.

While the creature is **charmed**, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence.
You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey.
You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target.
Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do.
During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom Saving Throw against the spell.
If the Saving Throw succeeds, the spell ends.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell with a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

# Control Weather

- **Range:** self
- **Shape:** sphere
- **Radius:** 5 miles
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water

---

## Description
You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration.
You must be outdoors to cast this spell.
Moving to a place where you don't have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.

When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the DM based on the climate and season.
You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind.
It takes `1d4 × 10` minutes for the new conditions to take effect.
Once they do so, you can change the conditions again.
When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.

When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down.
When changing the wind, you can change its direction.

The attacker must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or be **blinded** until the spell ends.

## Description
You draw the moisture from every creature in a 30-foot-long cube originating from a point you choose within range.
Each creature in that area must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
Constructs and undead aren't affected, and plants and water elementals make this Saving Throw with disadvantage.

# Antimagic Field

***8th-level abjuration***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Range:** self
- **Shape:** sphere
- **Radius:** 10 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings

---

## Description
A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you.
This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse.
Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane.
Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.

Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it.
A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed.
While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

### Targeted Effects
Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.

### Areas of Magic
The area of another spell or magical effect, such as [*fireball*](./fireball), can't extend into the sphere.
If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.
For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.

### Spells
Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.

### Magic Items
The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere.
For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.

A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere.
If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

### Magical Travel
Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel.
A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.

### Creatures and Objects
A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere.
Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.

### Dispel Magic
Spells and magical effects such as [*dispel magic*](./dispel-magic) have no effect on the sphere.
Likewise, the spheres created by different [*antimagic field*](./antimagic-field) spells don't nullify each other.

- **Duration:** 1 day
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, concentration

## Description
Your magic turns others into beasts.
Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range.
You transform each target into the form of a *large* or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower.
On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.

The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies.
You can choose a different form for each target.
A target's game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma Scores.
The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed.
If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form.
As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked **unconscious**.
The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells.

The target's gear melds into the new form.
The target can't activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't **blinded** by this spell.
Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this Saving Throw.

A creature **blinded** by this spell makes another Constitution Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns.

The creature can be anywhere on the same plane of existence as you.
The spell ends if you or the target are no longer on the same plane.

Until the spell ends, you and the target can instantaneously share words, images, sounds, and other sensory messages with one another through the link, and the target recognizes you as the creature it is communicating with.
The spell enables a creature with an Intelligence Score of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your words and take in the scope of any sensory messages you send to it.

# Illusory Dragon
- [ ] Homebrew

***8th-level illusion***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Tags:** somatic, concentration

---

## Description
By gathering threads of shadow material from the Shadowfell, you create a *huge* shadowy dragon in an unoccupied space that you can see within range.
The illusion lasts for the spell's duration and occupies its space, as if it were a creature.

When the illusion appears, any of your enemies that can see it must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or become **frightened** of it for 1 minute.
If a **frightened** creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to the illusion, it can repeat the Saving Throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 60 feet.
At any point during its movement, you can cause it to exhale a blast of energy in a 60-foot cone originating from its space.
When you create the dragon, choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, or poison.
Each creature in the cone must make an Intelligence Saving Throw, taking `7d6` damage of the chosen damage type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The illusion is tangible because of the shadow stuff used to create it, but attacks miss it automatically, it succeeds on all Saving Throws, and it is immune to all damage and conditions.
A creature that uses an action to examine the dragon can determine that it is an illusion by succeeding on an Intelligence Ability Check against your Spell Save DC.
If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through it and has advantage on Saving Throws against its breath.

## Description
You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range, attempting to shatter its intellect and personality.
The target takes `4d6` psychic damage and must make an Intelligence Saving Throw.

On a failed save, the creature's Intelligence and Charisma Scores become 1.
The creature can't cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way.
The creature can, however, identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them.

At the end of every 30 days, the creature can repeat its Saving Throw against this spell.
If it succeeds on its Saving Throw, the spell ends.

The spell can also be ended by [*greater restoration*](./greater-restoration), [*heal*](./heal), or [*wish*](./wish).

# Maze
- [ ] Homebrew

***8th-level conjuration***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 60 feet

## Description
You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane.
The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.

The target can use its action to attempt to escape.
When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence Ability Check.
If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or goristro demon automatically succeeds).

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

***8th-level evocation***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 500 feet
- **Shape:** sphere
- **Radius:** 100 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a pinch of dirt, a piece of rock, and a lump of clay

## Description
You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range.
For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.

The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain.
Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the creature's concentration is broken.

When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the creature is knocked **prone**.

This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.

### Fissures
Fissures open throughout the spell's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell.
A total of `1d6` such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM.
Each is `1d10 × 10` feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side.
A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or fall in.
A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure's edge as it opens.

A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).

### Structures
The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends.
If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures.
A creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes `5d6` bludgeoning damage, is knocked **prone**, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength Ability Check as an action to escape.
The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble.
On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall **prone** or become buried.

# Demiplane
- [ ] Homebrew

***8th-level conjuration***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Tags:** somatic

---

## Description
You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range.
The door is large enough to allow *medium* creatures to pass through unhindered.
When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone.
When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.

Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell.
Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.

# Wish
- [ ] Homebrew

***9th-level conjuration***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** instantaneous
- **Range:** self
- **Tags:** verbal

---

## Description
Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast.
By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.

The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower.
You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components.
The spell simply takes effect.
Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:
- You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item.
	The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.
- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the [*greater restoration*](./greater-restoration) spell.
- You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.
- You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.
	For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.
- You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn).
	Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result.
	For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save.
	You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.

You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples.
State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible.
The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong.
This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish.
For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game.
Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.

The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you.
After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take `1d10` necrotic damage per level of that spell.
This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way.
In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for `2d4` days.
For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days.
Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.

## Description
Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range.
You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into a nonmagical object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature).
The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies.
If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.

This spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.
An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom Saving Throw, and if it succeeds, it isn't affected by this spell.

### Creature into Creature
If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or its level, if the target doesn't have a challenge rating).
The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form.
It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed.
If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form.
As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked **unconscious**.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech unless its new form is capable of such actions.

The target's gear melds into the new form.
The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

### Object into Creature
You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature's size is no larger than the object's size and the creature's challenge rating is 9 or lower.
The creature is friendly to you and your companions.
It acts on each of your turns.
You decide what action it takes and how it moves.
The DM has the creature's statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.

If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature.
It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.

### Creature into Object
If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form, as long as the object's size is no larger than the creature's size.
The creature's statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.

## Description
You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself.
No time passes for other creatures, while you take `1d4 + 1` turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.

This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you.
In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it.

A creature takes `20d6` fire damage and `20d6` bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.

The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

# Gate

***9th-level conjuration***

- **Duration:** 1 minute

- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material, concentration
- **Material Components:** a diamond worth at least 5,000 gp

## Description
You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence.
The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter.
You can orient the portal in any direction you choose.
The portal lasts for the duration.

The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears.
Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front.
Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.

Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.

When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn't work).
If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature's immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal.
You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the DM deems appropriate.
It might leave, attack you, or help you.

# Power Word Kill

# Astral Projection
- [ ] Homebrew

***9th-level necromancy***
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Duration:** special
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Instances:** 9
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** for each creature you affect with this spell, you must provide one jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at least 100 gp, all of which the spell consumes

---

## Description
You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane).
The material body you leave behind is **unconscious** and in a state of suspended animation, it doesn't need food or air and doesn't age.

Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions.
The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot.
This cord is your tether to your material body.
As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home.
If the cord is cut-something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does-your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.

Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane.
If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane.
Your astral form is a separate incarnation.
Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.

The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it.
When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.

The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions.
A successful [*dispel magic*](./dispel-magic) spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature.
If a creature's original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature.
If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature's astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.

If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.

## Description
A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and spreading to a radius of 360 feet.
Lightning flashes in the area, thunder booms, and strong winds roar.
Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes `2d6` thunder damage and becomes **deafened** for 5 minutes.

Each round you maintain concentration on this spell, the storm produces different effects on your turn.

### Round 2
Acidic rain falls from the cloud.
Each creature and object under the cloud takes `1d6` acid damage.

### Round 3
You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six creatures or objects of your choice beneath the cloud.
A given creature or object can't be struck by more than one bolt.
A struck creature must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
The creature takes `10d6` lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Round 4
Hailstones rain down from the cloud.
Each creature under the cloud takes `2d6` bludgeoning damage.

### Round 5&ndash;10
Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud.
The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured.
Each creature there takes `1d6` cold damage.
Ranged Weapon Attacks in the area are impossible.
The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on spells.
Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane or magical.

Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them.
Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
On a failed save, a creature becomes **frightened** for the duration.
The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat.

On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and isn't **stunned**.

On a successful save, the stunning effect ends.

# Imprisonment
- [ ] Homebrew

***9th-level abjuration***
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Duration:** indefinate
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic, material
- **Material Components:** a vellum depiction or a carved statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special component that varies according to the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die of the target

---

## Description
You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range.
The target must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again.
While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age.
Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target.

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.

### Burial
The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target.
Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.

The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.

### Chaining
Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place.
The target is **restrained** until the spell ends, and it can't move or be moved by any means until then.

The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.

### Hedged Prison
The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel.
The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.

The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.

### Minimus Containment
The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object.
Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel.
The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.

The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.

### Slumber
The target falls asleep and can't be awoken.

The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.

### Ending the Spell
During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target.
The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass.
The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.

A [*dispel magic*](./dispel-magic) spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.

You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time.
If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.

## Description
You transform up to ten creatures of your choice that you can see within range.
An unwilling target must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw to resist the transformation.
An unwilling shapechanger automatically succeeds on the save.

Each target assumes a beast form of your choice, and you can choose the same form or different ones for each target.
The new form can be any beast you have seen whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or half the target's level, if the target doesn't have a challenge rating).
The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, but the target retains its hit points, alignment, and personality.

Each target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the hit points of its new form.
These temporary hit points can't be replaced by temporary hit points from another source.
A target reverts to its normal form when it has no more temporary hit points or it dies.
If the spell ends before then, the creature loses all its temporary hit points and reverts to its normal form.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form.
It can't speak, cast spells, or do anything else that requires hands or speech.

The target's gear melds into the new form.
The target can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs.
If the creature was undead, it is restored to its non-undead form.

# Prismatic Wall
- [ ] Homebrew

***9th-level abjuration***
- **Casting Time:** action
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Shape:** wall
- **Height:** 30 feet
- **Length:** 90 feet
- **Width:** 1 inch
- **Tags:** verbal, somatic

---

## Description
A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall&mdash;up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick&mdash;centered on a point you can see within range.
Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range.
The wall remains in place for the duration.
If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.

The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet.
You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm.
If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or become **blinded** for 1 minute.

The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color.
When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall's layers.
As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity Saving Throw or be affected by that layer's properties as described below.

The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer.
Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell.
An antimagic field has no effect on a prismatic wall.

### Red
The creature takes `10d6` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
While this layer is in place, nonmagical Ranged Attacks can't pass through the wall.
The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.

### Orange
The creature takes `10d6` acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
While this layer is in place, magical Ranged Attacks can't pass through the wall.
The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.

### Yellow
The creature takes `10d6` lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.

### Green
The creature takes `10d6` poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.

### Blue
The creature takes `10d6` cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.

### Indigo
On a failed save, the creature is **restrained**.
It must then make a Constitution Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns.
If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends.
If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the **petrified** condition.
The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.

While this layer is in place, spells can't be cast through the wall.
The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.

### Violet
On a failed save, the creature is **blinded**.
It must then make a Wisdom Saving Throw at the start of your next turn.
A successful save ends the blindness.
If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM's choosing and is no longer **blinded**.
(Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a [*dispel magic*](./dispel-magic) spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.

## Description
You assume the form of a different creature for the duration.
The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower.
The creature can't be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once.
You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.

Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma Scores.
You also retain all of your skill and Saving Throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature.
If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus in place of yours.
You can't use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.

You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form.
When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed.
If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.
As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked **unconscious**.

You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so.
You can't use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense.
You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.

When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it.
Worn equipment functions as normal.
The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size.
Your equipment doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form.
Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.

During this spell's duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.
